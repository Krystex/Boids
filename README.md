# Boids 

Experimental boid simulation with custom ECS (Entity-Component-System). 

Implemented to study group behaviour and mainly the ECS pattern.
Everything is implemented in vanilla JS. A basic linear algebra library was implemented for this purpose.

Performance is not a important goal for this project.


## Findings
Findings for ECS:
- data interaction between different systems can be messy
