Experimental boid simulation with custom ECS (Entity Component System).

Implemented to stude the Entity Component System pattern.
Everything is implemented in vanilla JS. A basic linear algebra library was implemented for this purpose.


Performance is not a important goal for this project.

The **entity component system** has three essential primitives:
- **Entity**: basic object in scene, e.g. a boid
  
  *One entity has multiple components*
- **Component**: data which describes behaviour, e.g. `LineRenderable` with attributes color and width

  *One component only has data, no actual code*
- **System**: actually implemented behaviour, e.g. `PhysicsSystem`
  
  *In main game loop, every system is executed. Method `onEntity` is executed for every available entity*
  


## Findings
Findings for ECS:
- data interaction between different systems can be messy (`BoidSystem` modifies velocity vector, `PhysicsSystem` applies velocity too)
